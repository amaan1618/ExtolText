				Nothing Gold Can Stay





	Nature’s first green is gold,
	Her hardest hue to hold.
	Her early leaf’s a flower;
	But only so an hour.
	Then leaf subsides to leaf.
	So Eden sank to grief,
	So dawn goes down to day.
	Nothing gold can stay.


A Brief Background:
	"Nothing Gold Can Stay" is a short poem written by Robert Frost in 1923.
	It was later published in the collection New Hampshire(1923), which earned Robert Frost the 1924 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. The poem lapsed into public domain in 2019. New Hampshire also included Frost's poems "Fire and Ice" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening".

Theme:
	The Transistory(fleeting) nature of life is the primary theme of "Nothing Gold Can Stay" theme. Other ways to express this theme could be:"All good things must come to an end" or "Nothing young, good or beautiful can stay that way forever." 

Message:
	"Nothing Gold Can Stay" emphasizes the fleeting nature of youth, beauty, and life itself. As trees lose their leaves and then the buds, leaves and blooms reappear the following spring, so people age and eventually pass from the earth. This is part of the cycle of life and death, and rebirth.

Summary:
	In early spring, the fresh buds on the trees are gold. This color is the quickest to disappear from the natural world, however. The fresh blossoms on the trees are flowers, but these flowers disappear quickly too. They turn into leaves that fall to the ground, just as humankind fell from the paradise of the Garden of Eden, and just as the promising early light of morning gives way to daytime. Nothing beautiful, fresh, or pure can last forever.

Literary Devices:
	Frost uses many literary devices in his poem such as Imagery, Personification, Allusion and Metaphor

Conclusion:
	We can come to the conclusion that this poem like many of Frost's other poems convey a very deep meaning. If we can understand the poem and take it to heart, then we can learn to enjoy even the smallest things while it lasts.
